Choreography of Managed Components and Services
===============================================

These are the main abilities which need to be taken into consideration when
addressing the dilemma:

**Hyper Convergence**

The ability to consistently manage a diverse variety of technologies and align
possibly different functional and non-functional requirements.

**Lifecycle Automation**

The ability to manage the full lifecycle of all technological components and
services in an automated manner.

**Closed Loop Control**

The ability to continuously evaluate the lifecycle state and configurations of
components and services and triggering policies as needed in order to fulfill
the customer requirements.

**Model-Driven Automation**

The ability to manage automation procedures with the help of models which
define the desired outcome instead of having to provide custom code which
describes for each type of requirement how to apply the needed changes.

**Dependency Management**

The ability to consistent handle the dependencies between different components
and services when applying changes.

**Fault Tolerance**

The ability to recover from unforeseen errors and reestablish a comprehensive
lifecycle management for all components and services.

**Reconciliation**

The ability to recover from manual interventions and reestablish a comprehensive
lifecycle management for all components and services.

**Concurrency**

The ability to consistently handle multiple concurrent customer requests and
changes in a well-defined manner.

**Scalability**

The ability to seamlessly scale with the number of managed component, services
as well with the number of changes regardless of the location of the managed
elements.

**Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**

The ability to continuously roll-out or roll-back versions of components and
services in a well-defined manner.

**Near Real Time**

The ability to manage changes in a close to real time timescale.


**High Availability**

The ability to provide highly available services even when applying changes.
