Versions
========

> Versions mark how components change their purpose over time

Over time components will have to change the functionality they provide to their
service consumers (other components or users). These changes need to be
accounted for and are captured by tagging each specification with a version tag
as specified by the rules for [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

The rules state that given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH,
one needs to increment the:

1. MAJOR version when an incompatible change is made,
2. MINOR version when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner, and
3. PATCH version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are applied.
