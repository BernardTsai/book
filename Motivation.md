<div class="subtitle">How can we constantly change and optimise customer services which require the well-aligned interaction of various technologies and at the same time maintain overall service quality according to the customers needs.</div>

Customer services nowadays make use of a vast amount of different technologies.
Ensuring service quality for the customers therefore needs to align the
various corresponding management concepts in such a way that a customer
requirement is broken down into a sequence of changes on the appropriate
technological components.

Technological evolution and the rapid increase of automation capabilities has
lead in the previous years to a plethora of heterogenous management concepts
which require rather immense integration efforts due to the complexity of the
possible interaction patterns.

Taking into account that technological change is part of the game a core dilemma
as stated above becomes obvious.

There is no golden bullet solution for solving this dilemma in the context of
highly automated technology based services. Each approach has its advantages and
disadvantages.

There are two traditional approaches of how to tackle this dilemma and an
alternative concept which will be introduced in this book.

**Approach A: Don't touch a running system**

This approach is favoured by many Telco operators who need to guarantee a
service quality of 99,999% service availability and often reduce the
introduction of new technical features to an absolute minimum.

**Approach B: Throw away**

Why try to ensure compatibility with old hardware? Simply throw away
the old technology and make use of the advantages of the new one.
This has been the motto for the introduction of many storage technologies
ranging from magnetic tapes, hard drives, solid state disks and
cloud storage facilities. Each of the technological options addressed different
qualities and found their own market leaving the consumer with the task to
tackle the actual migration.

**Approach C: Choreography of Managed Components and Services**

This book presents a third approach of how to bridge the requirements related to
change and in parallel maintaining a well defined service quality based on a
choreography of managed components and services.

The disadvantage being that the various management and automation concepts need
to adhere to a common way of interacting with one another.
The benefits of this approach allow for the continuous integration of ever
changing technological services in a seamless manner thereby focussing on the
need of the customers in a consistent way.

The main abilities of such a solution approach are detailed in the chapter
