# Foreword

There is a proliferation of new technologies which have the potential to provide exciting new types of services to the customers. This leads to a continuous evolution of the technological landscape which needs to be managed consistently so that the users of these services on the one hand benefit from the new features but at the same time can rely on the service quality.

This is an example of the stability/flexibility dilemma and there are many traditional ways of how to address this, e.g.

- don't change anything,
- build different isolated solutions,
- introduce change advisory boards,
- etc.

In the age of automation where recurring tasks can be executed much faster a specific set of guidelines will allow to solve this dilemma in a more efficient way.

This book will describe such an approach and is intended for a technical audience which would not only want to learn about the main ideas but is interested in applying these concepts to their domain of interest.
