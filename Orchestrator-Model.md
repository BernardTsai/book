Orchestrator Model
==================

> The orchestrator model closely reflects the entities defined in the information model supporting the sourcing, design and operations phase of a
solution.

The following diagram provides an overview of the model which the orchestration engine uses.

The model follows the structure defined in the [information Model](Model.md)
and is clearly subdivided into domains which allow for differentiating administrative realms.

In addition it differentiates between sections for information obtained in the sourcing phase (Catalog), the design/development phase (Architecture) and the operations phase (Solution).

The information related to the automation of the lifecycle of the solution elements is persisted in the Automation section.
