Endpoints
=========

> Channels for accessing services

Endpoints describe how the services of a component can be accessed.
The service consumers need to able to interpret this information in order to
access the [service](./Concepts-Services.md) of the service providing component.

Endpoints may change over time and the distribution of any changes to the
endpoint information needs to be well organised in order to ensure a consistent
service network.
