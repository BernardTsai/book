Configuration
=============

<div class="subtitle"> Configuration customises a component to the environment and general requirements of its service consumers.</div>

The configuration of a component is a type and possibly version specific task
which can not be handled in a generic fashion but has to be executed by the
corresponding controller.

Nevertheless it is possible to distinguish between following aspects of the
required configuration information:

* the data a component requires to match its runtime-context
* the data a component requires to match its service-context
* the data a component requires to match its cluster-context
* the data a component requires to parametrise its generic service behaviour
