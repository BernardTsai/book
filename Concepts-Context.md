> Core assumptions and prerequisites

The solution approach is based on following assumptions and prerequisites:

* users consume services and require a certain quality of service,
* these services are provided by a set of technological components,
* each of these components can be fully controlled via automation APIs,
* there is an administrative realm allowing access to all available
  automation APIs,
* only some of the automation APIs will be exposed directly to the users for self-service purposes.
