# Introduction

Typical solutions nowadays consist of a multitude of different solution
elements which need to interact consistently in order to provide the desired
services. These services are typically provided to the users as managed services
in the sense that the user need not be concerned of how to assemble and maintain
the various solution elements. This task can be handled by a DevOps teams which
has partnered with a set of vendors providing the solution components
from which the solution architecture with its elements can be derived.

It is not a trivial task for the DevOps team and this book will list a couple of
the issues they will encounter when attempting to provide high quality services
in a constantly evolving context.

The main expertise which a DevOps team needs to acquire the capability of
managing the solution according to the varying demand of it's users and the
required changes related to the lifecycle of its solution elements.

The value chain for a solution shown in the following diagram depicts
how vendors of solution components and the DevOps team need to work together
in order to provide a managed service to the users.

In the sourcing phase the vendors provide the components for the customer
solutions. These serve as building blocks for the architecture which the
DevOps teams design for their users in the development phase.
The architecture is then instantiated in the operations phase and continuously
updated in order to support the lifecycle of the managed service.
