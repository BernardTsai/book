Concepts
========

The choreography of managed components makes use of a couple of core concepts
which serve as the foundation for the actual solution design:

* [Context:](./Concepts-Context.md) assumptions and prerequisites
* [Decomposition:](./Concepts-Decomposition.md) divide and conquer
* [Components:](./Concepts-Components.md) everything is a component
* [Services:](./Concepts-Services.md) purpose of components
* [Versions:](./Concepts-Versions.md) evolution of services
* [Endpoints:](./Concepts-Endpoints.md) service channels
* [Cluster:](./Concepts-Cluster.md) no single points of failure
* [Versioning:](./Concepts-Versioning.md) evolution of component and services
* [Lifecycle Model:](./Concepts-Lifecycle.md) initial, inactive, active, failure
* [Dependencies:](./Concepts-Dependencies.md) interaction patterns
* [Closed-Loop:](./Concepts-ClosedLoop.md) converging towards target states
* [Configuration:](./Concepts-Configuration.md) customization of components

These concepts are detailed in the corresponding subchapters and together
determine the design of the orchestration algorithm.
