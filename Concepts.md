Composable solution architectures simplify lifecycle automation.
</div>

The basic idea behind the orchestration approach presented in this book is not to create an extremely powerful system capable of handling even the most exotic cases but rather identify a set of best practices which would reshape the overall complexity in such a way that the various management tools can work efficiently together based on what they can do best.

These best practices/core concepts allow for a choreography of managed components and serve as the foundation for the design of composable solution architectures:

* [Prerequisites:](./Concepts-Prerequisites.md) assumptions and prerequisites
* [Decomposition:](./Concepts-Decomposition.md) divide and conquer
* [Components:](./Concepts-Components.md) everything is a component
* [Services:](./Concepts-Services.md) purpose of components
* [Versions:](./Concepts-Versions.md) evolution of services
* [Cluster:](./Concepts-Cluster.md) no single points of failure
* [Lifecycle Model:](./Concepts-Lifecycle.md) initial, inactive, active, failure
* [Dependencies:](./Concepts-Dependencies.md) interaction patterns
* [Closed-Loop:](./Concepts-ClosedLoop.md) converging towards target states
* [Configuration:](./Concepts-Configuration.md) customization of components

These concepts are detailed in the corresponding subchapters and together
simplify the design of the orchestration algorithm.
